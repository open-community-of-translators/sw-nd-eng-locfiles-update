 # Habitable worlds
 ####################################

 panthalassic_world: "Panthalassic World"
 panthalassic_world_desc: "This ocean world is completely devoid of land. The entire surface of the planet is one enormous, constantly moving ocean. Construction of buildings on this planet is possible only on the ocean bed or on specially built floating platforms."
 poisonous_world: "Poisonous World"
 poisonous_world_desc: "This humid world is covered with dense tropical jungle and swampy plains teeming with poisonous plants and animals. Once this world was a blossoming tropical paradise, where biological diversity reached incredible heights, and not a single mass extinction occurred over many millions of years. As a result, the complete absence of differences in ecosystems led to species competition. The struggle for survival has led evolution along the path of development of toxic secretions as a means of protection and hunting. Virtually all animals of the planet, without exception, are capable of killing one of hundreds of thousands of species of poisons and are not suitable for food due to the high risk of poisoning."
 swamp_world: "Swamp World"
 swamp_world_desc: "This is a world of murky swamps, poisonous fumes, and coal forests. There are almost no open bodies of water on the planet, but there is some hydrosphere consisting of endless swamps and flooded jungles with small muddy islets. Thanks to these conditions, this world is an excellent source of various organic gases."
 karst_world: "Karst World"
 karst_world_desc: "This planet was once an oceanic world, but as a result of changes in the activity of the star the oceans slowly evaporated, exposing the surface covered with deep scars and cavities. Now, the entire planet is covered by giant canyons and a huge network of caves, which greatly facilitate access to mineral resources. On the flip side, the presence of such a huge number of hidden formations will attract many pirate and terrorist groups."
 glacial_world: "Glacial World"
 glacial_world_desc: "Much of the surface of this planet is covered in a huge ice shell. An incredible frost reigns in this world, and deadly snowstorms prevent the development of more than a meager biosphere. The almost lifeless landscape consists of ice rocks and occasionally weathered cliffs, opening access to rare minerals under the surface of the planet."
 dune_world: "Dune World"
 dune_world_desc: "This planet consists of an endless sea of dunes interrupted only by rare mountain ranges. In this world of desert, there are no open sources of water. Small water sources can only be found at the cooler polar caps or deep underground. Frequent sandstorms regularly grind down what is on the surface."
 boreal_world: "Boreal World"
 boreal_world_desc: "Not so long ago (by cosmic standards), this planet survived the ice age. Now its glaciers are retreating, baring the earth that was previously covered in ice. Wild rivers and geothermal zones hidden in the depths of the moving glaciers will serve as an excellent source of energy. The low temperature and frozen lands are, however, harsh. Coniferous plants dominate its surface landscape, competing with different mosses and lichens."
 young_world: "Young World"
 young_world_desc: "This planet is in the early stages of its life. Massive volcanic activity on its surface creates challenging conditions for colonization. However, the geological activity of the mantle promises abundant of energy to be harnessed."
 tempest_world: "Tempest World"
 tempest_world_desc: "This is a world of paradox, cooled by the heat of the local star. In fact, this is a common phenomenon in which the gravitational position of the planet in relation to its parent star in the solar system causes the atmosphere to be in constant motion. The unceasing winds increase heat exchange and cool what rests on the surface. This is a very harsh planet, whose landscape is polished by storms. Animal and plant life is extremely sparse and exists only in caves and shelters."
 geothermal_world: "Geothermal World"
 geothermal_world_desc: "This world would be another frozen ball in endless space, but the incredible activity of the planet's interior has done its job. Many areas of this planet have been completely ice-free. Now it is a world of hot springs and frequent geysers, where glacial wastelands coexist with lush jungle."
 forest_world: "Forest World"
 forest_world_desc: "This world's flora has prospered and built a monument to its greatness. The planet is covered by multi-leveled forests and jungles, the crowns of its innumerable trees tickling the sky. The animal world is diverse, but often serves only as prey for predatory plants which are abundant on the surface."
 dust_world: "Dust World"
 dust_world_desc: "This extremely arid world has undergone severe degredation of the soil due to continuous, uncontrolled erosion. Mighty winds occasionally raise huge dust storms that rage across the planetary surface, plunging the sky into a perpetual rusty twilight, over the centuries grinding down the mountain ranges."
 oasis_world: "Oasis World"
 oasis_world_desc: "This desert paradise is dominated by a single ocean, which occupies 15% of the surface. The rest of the planet is covered by extensive desert biomes hidden mostly in rain shadow. Vegegation concentrates on the coast of this great body of water, which has over time reached some distance into the desert interior."
 salt_world: "Salt World"
 salt_world_desc: "Once dominated by large, cool oceans, this world had both a humid climate and rich biosphere. Then an unknown cataclysm, possibly related to changes in the activity of its home star, caused the oceans to suddenly evaporate. Half the surface is covered with endless salt flats suitable for only extremophile organisms. The little liquid remaining is now concentrated into extremely salty brine seas."
 steppe_world: "Steppe World"
 steppe_world_desc: "Special environmental conditions and natural selection directed the evolution of the local flora along a path that completely deprived this planet of trees. The surface is covered with many inland seas, which are separated by endless plains of grassy meadows and steppe pastures."
 snow_world: "Snow World"
 snow_world_desc: "This mountainous world has recently experienced a period of global glaciation. Most of the flat surfaces, free from extensive mountain ranges, are covered with glaciers. The equatorial zone is dominated by a temperate boreal climate with uneven seasonal temperature fluctuations. Inland seas keep warm for a long time, and mountain ranges hold back cold air currents. Thus, constant fluctuations in atmospheric pressure arise. On the planet, there is a constant struggle between cold glacial and warm equatorial air masses, which generate violent snow storms."
 melting_world: "Melting World"
 melting_world_desc: "This continental world once had oceans completely covered by ice shelves. As a result of a long period of global warming, most of the oceanic surface is now liquid, with the last remaining shelves at the poles forming calving giant icebergs that still can be several kilometers in diameter."
 equatorial_world: "Equatorial World"
 equatorial_world_desc: "This cold world has a narrow temperate equatorial region with conditions suitable for agriculture. Glacial retreat in this area has also exposed numerous surface mineral deposits."
 cold_desert: "Cold Desert"
 cold_desert_desc: "A world of constant frosts and a weak liquid hydrosphere, this planet is nearly barren. The cold rocky surface is inhospitable to even the most hardy of agricultural crops."
 supercontinental_world: "Supercontinental World"
 supercontinental_world_desc: "The tectonic plates and continental masses of this world have currently formed one supercontinent. Although the coastal regions are a thriving paradise, the continental zones, far from the fertile river valleys near the coast, consist mainly of dry steppe and sun-scorched arid biomes stretching over thousands of kilometers. Violent weather and hurricanes force winds deep in the main lands and are deadly to the unprepared visitor."
 atoll_world: "Atoll World"
 atoll_world_desc: "While tectonics did not allow the formation of large landmasses on this world, it was nonetheless covered in massive undersea volcanoes constantly forming smaller islands. Over the eons, many of these volcanic islands eroded and were covered by the ocean becoming home to megacorals. The megacorals form the distinctive giant atolls of this tropical paradise. Distributed almost evenly from pole to pole, the giant coral islands of this world are a true masterpiece of natural creation."
 algic_seas: "Algic Seas"
 algic_seas_desc: "A world of great beauty, this planet is covered in supercolonies of algae that migrate across the oceans, painting them in vivid red and green hues. Substances excreted from some species have unique healing properties that can be put to great medical use."
 monsoon_world: "Monsoon World"
 monsoon_world_desc: "Orbital and geographic features of this world lead to sudden changes in wind direction over its seasons. Rapid heating of the land in summer causes large-scale flooding from inward-moving monsoon rains, while the winters are fairly dry as the air returns to the sea. This world would be almost ideal for habitation if not for the numerous large hurricanes that form in late summer as the oceans warm."
 ancient_world: "Ancient World"
 ancient_world_desc: "Many millenia ago, this world was the cradle of some forgotten precursor civilization, their identity remaining a mystery to this day. Where once stood an ecumenopolis, raw life has reclaimed the planet. The remains of giant buildings peek out from the dense forests, while oceans have covered entire city districts once protected by colossal dams."
 depleted_world: "Depleted World"
 depleted_world_desc: "Once a center of industry and arts, this world was abandoned entirely by its billions of residents  after some unknown disaster. Over the millenia the infrastructure guarding the dangerous leftovers of a developed civilization wasted away. Pollution left over from old technological catastrophies and chemical poisoning of the water table has made this planet largely incapable of supporting advanced life."
 rocky_world: "Rocky World"
 rocky_world_desc: "Frequent storms and strong winds on this planet contributed to the strong weathering of its geological formations. As a result, much of the surface of this world is eroded rocks."
 primal_world: "Primal World"
 primal_world_desc: "This world is still quite young and is experiencing frequent periods of volcanic activity. The lush jungle can be abruptly replaced by dead wastelands. Lava flows erupting from the bowels of the planet spread through the valleys and canyons, absorbing the once-blooming land, and turning it into a hellish landscape."
 mesa_world: "Mesa World"
 mesa_world_desc: "Frequent, sometimes unpredictable, changes in the warm and cold seasons of this world lead to strong winds and drought. Over the course of many millions of years, constant weathering has transformed the planet's topography into canyon-ridged plateaus and vast mesas. The planet's meager biosphere thrives only near rare water bodies in the polar zone."
 bog_world: "Bog World"
 bog_world_desc: "This cold world has virtually no solid soil for construction and is denied access to open mineral deposits. The entire surface of the planet is covered with peat bogs and dirty lakes. Despite the cold, harsh climate of the planet, high humidity and fertile soil make this world attractive for agriculture."
 storm_world: "Storm World"
 storm_world_desc: "This watery planet is prone to violent storms that occur in huge numbers in the atmosphere. The small dry land of this world has turned into bare rocks, on which there is practically no life."
 mediterranean_world: "Mediterranean World"
 mediterranean_world_desc: "This arid, rocky world contains several large inland seas, the coasts of which are less affected by the hot climate. Many fertile regions are concentrated in the coastal regions, where a temperate climate with rare dry seasons prevails."
 plateau_world: "Plateau World"
 plateau_world_desc: "Most of the surface of this cold planet consists of vast plateaus, indented by gorges and separated by hollows. This world bears the traces of extensive erosion processes, probably once it was covered by oceans. Elevated spaces are great for power plants, and eroded deposits make it easier to mine minerals."
 megaflora_world: "Megaflora World"
 megaflora_world_desc: "Stuffy, dense jungle and giant creeping roots cover the entire surface of this planet. The rich flora of this world shows incredible tenacity and growth rate, in attempts to take possession of any free area of space. With such an aggressive spread of local vegetation, the development and maintenance of infrastructure is a very difficult task."
 coriolis_world: "Coriolis World"
 coriolis_world_desc: "Due to the high speed of rotation of the planet, this world is subject to strong, incessant winds that always blow in the same direction. Closer to the equator, the speed of air currents increases. Friction of air against rocks in these areas creates the effect of intense heating of the surface and atmosphere. Many life forms on this planet have adapted to the harsh conditions of the windy wasteland. The fauna and flora of the planet exist in a closed cycle of constantly moving air masses in the vicinity of extended equatorial water bodies."
 mineral_world: "Mineral World"
 mineral_world_desc: "A huge amount of various minerals is concentrated in the crust of this planet. The active movement of tectonic plates forms mountain massifs from ore-rich rock formations with a predominantly crystalline structure. At the same time, this world is practically devoid of soft soil cover, and the harsh climatic conditions do not allow the planet's biosphere to actively develop."
 ice_world: "Ice World"
 ice_world_desc: "A sharp change in the activity of the local luminary led to the rapid glaciation of this oceanic world. In a very short period of time, the water surface of the planet was covered with a thick ice crust. Deadly blizzards rage in the endless icy wastelands, but life thrives under the ice shell of the ocean, which one day will once again break free."
 crag_world: "Crag World"
 crag_world_desc: "This oceanic planet is dotted with archipelagos of volcanic islands. Rare pieces of land that rise above the surface of the endless ocean are clusters of prismatic structures. These outcrops are composed of a variety of effusive rocks and may contain rare valuable minerals."
 prairie_world: "Prairie World"
 prairie_world_desc: "Great landmasses, separated by large inland seas and mountain ranges, are covered with endless fertile lands. This world is dominated by a temperate seasonal climate. Wet and hot summers last long and give way to short but cold and harsh winters."
 veld_world: "Veld World"
 veld_world_desc: "A semi-arid subtropical climate and predominantly mountainous landscape has transformed this world into a patchwork quilt of lush coastal prairies, flooded grasslands, hot savannas and desert plateaus. The local biosphere forms around some tree species that develop extensive root systems to compensate for the long dry seasons. An extensive root system can hardly exist for more than several decades, but those that continue to grow allow the trees to develop into mega-acacia trees and create around themselves a kind of oases with permanent centers of blooming life."
 adiabatic_world: "Adiabatic World"
 adiabatic_world_desc: "Overly active mountain building in the past has trapped the planet's initially meager hydrosphere. As a result of constant processes of cooling and compression of moisture in the upper atmosphere, most of the planet is in the rain shadow. Rare life exists near bodies of water, while 90% of the surface is very dry desert."
 frigid_world: "Frigid World"
 frigid_world_desc: "This harsh, rocky world is bounded by constant frost. Most of the planet is a frozen wasteland, blown by cold winds. The few life forms live mostly in mountain caves."
 mushroom_world: "Mushroom World"
 mushroom_world_desc: "The biosphere of this cold world consists mainly of fungal life forms that have adapted well to harsh conditions. The giant mushroom forests are a myriad of islets of tumultuous life, separated by swampy tundra and windy wastelands."
 taiga_world: "Taiga World"
 taiga_world_desc: "Due to its relatively mild seasonal climate and humidity, this planet has extensive equatorial forest cover. The harsh taiga forests are well adapted to long winters. Even closer to the poles, there are many areas of forest-tundra and swamps, which are replaced by frozen wastelands."
 highland_world: "Highland World"
 highland_world_desc: "Much of the surface of this cold planet is a highly intricate system of mountain ranges, forming a relief of hollows, plateaus and valleys with inland seas. This world is characterized by strong elevation changes and an almost complete absence of vast plains."
 noxious_world: "Noxious World"
 noxious_world_desc: "Millions of years ago, this planet was a flourishing paradise with rapidly growing fauna that rapidly filled all living space. Even the oceans could not withstand the biomass pressure, the planet began to turn into a rapidly growing and decaying swamp. Heavy poisonous gases produced by the decaying swamps filled all the lowlands. On the surface of the planet, only safe islands of life in the highlands have survived, separated by toxic swamps, where only the most adapted representatives of flora and fauna live."
 forgotten_world: "Forgotten World"
 forgotten_world_desc: "Many millennia ago, this world was the cultural center of a mysterious civilization. Now this fragment of the past attracts adventurers from different parts of the galaxy for the sake of searching for valuable artifacts, forbidden knowledge and simple curiosity."
 aeolian_world: "Aeolian World"
 aeolian_world_desc: "Most of the surface of this planet is porous rock formations, formed by the severe weathering of volcanic rocks. The sandstorms of this world are extremely destructive because of the large and sharp sand grains, which are accelerated by hurricane winds to such a speed that they can deform even the strongest structures."
 mesocyclonic_world: "Mesocyclonic World"
 mesocyclonic_world_desc: "Severe pressure fluctuations in the atmosphere of this flat planet result in the frequent formation of many air vortices of varying sizes. In this harsh world of destructive tornadoes, only the toughest life forms survive."
 effusive_world: "Effusive World"
 effusive_world_desc: "This world has only recently emerged from an active volcanic cycle. The surface of the planet is slowly cooling, and noxious fumes of sulfur and other gases are escaping from the many volcanic crevices."
 reef_world: "Reef World"
 reef_world_desc: "This oceanic world has almost no water depths. The entire surface of the planet is shallow oceans with complex systems of rocky reefs of volcanic origin."
 iceberg_world: "Iceberg World"
 iceberg_world_desc: "This oceanic world was once completely frozen; as a result of a long period of warming, much of the water surface has already become free of ice. Shelf glaciers at the poles constantly produce many icebergs, some of which can reach several kilometers in diameter."
 moraine_world: "Moraine World"
 moraine_world_desc: "This world is closed in a cycle of short periods of glaciation and warming. As a result, the planet's ice sheet is in constant motion. Most of the planet's surface is a moving layer of shards of rocks and ice."
 wasteland_world: "Wasteland World"
 wasteland_world_desc: "The great war that destroyed much of life has long since raged on this planet. Almost the entire surface has become a hot desert, tormented by dust storms, and in some areas of this world, radiation levels are still high."
 fallout_world: "Fallout World"
 fallout_world_desc: "This world has just recently experienced a nuclear apocalypse that set off a chain reaction that is rapidly destroying the planet's ecosystem. Massive radioactive contamination of the environment has led to the almost total extinction of life. There is practically no place left that would not be touched by the self inflicted disaster. The planet is on the brink of destruction."
 garden_world: "Garden World"
 garden_world_desc: "This picturesque planet is the result of a global terraforming project that has turned this world into a beautiful idyll for all forms of life. The multitude of biomes with unique ecosystems is striking, but there are virtually no minerals."
 rust_world: "Rust World"
 rust_world_desc: "This world was a giant city that was once a thriving center of communication and commerce. Now it is a bleak planet with an endless labyrinth of rusting structures that serves only as a reminder of the former greatness of its inhabitants."
 flaming_world: "Flaming World"
 flaming_world_desc: "This tidally locked world is too close to its star. Even on the twilight belt, life is extremely difficult due to hellish heat and strong winds. A fiery storm is constantly raging on the sunny side, and rivers of lava flow into the valleys from high plateaus."
 eyeball_world: "Eyeball World"
 eyeball_world_desc: "In this tidally locked world, violent sea storms eternally rage. While the ocean boils on the day side, the ice forming in the night side melts and crumbles in the twilight zone as the ice wall is pressed and moved by the winds."
 meridiem_world: "Meridiem World"
 meridiem_world_desc: "This tidally locked world stands out with its very mild conditions. Despite the fact that the twilight belt has almost constant cold, a mild, tropical climate prevails on the day side."
 
 lava_world: "Lava World"
 lava_world_desc: "The entire surface of this planet has turned into a huge lava cauldron. Hundreds of volcanoes simultaneously eject magma onto the surface, which spreads over the surface and forms whole seas of hot rock. Due to pollution by volcanic outbursts, the scarce nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere is almost unsuitable for breathing. And on some wretched pieces of land, a unique life has even survived, which was able to adapt to monstrous conditions."
 ash_world: "Ash World"
 ash_world_desc: "This rocky world is going through an acute phase of a global volcanic winter. Active tectonic processes on the planet have stopped, but the atmosphere is heavily polluted with ash and sulfurous gases. The dense cover of volcanic emissions has led to an anti-greenhouse effect, and sunlight hardly reaches the surface."
 archean_world: "Archean World"
 archean_world_desc: "This planet is at a very early stage in the formation of organic life. Thanks to the photosynthesis of microbiota actively developing in shallow seas, a stable nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere has been formed. The continuing increase in oxygen saturation of the atmosphere will one day lead to an oxygen catastrophe and the onset of global glaciation."
 
 infernal_world: "Infernal World"
 infernal_world_desc: "The huge cavities and tunnels beneath the surface of the molten planet are likely a result of the activity of the hydrosphere of this world, which once occupied a significant part of it. As a result of tectonic changes and a sharp overheating of the surface, a network of closed caves was formed. Surprisingly, under the surface of this blazing hell, there is a hidden world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The extremophilic biosphere is mainly composed of the simplest forms that maintain the delicate balance of this world."
 subglacial_world: "Subglacial World"
 subglacial_world_desc: "Under the ice of this frozen world lies a hidden network of giant caves and oceans reaching deep into the planet's crust. This impressive but structurally unstable world has a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a poor but fully developed and stable biosphere."
