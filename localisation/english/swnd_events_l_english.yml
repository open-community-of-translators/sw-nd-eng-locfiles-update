 swp_anomaly.0.desc:0 "We have entered a system with a unique planet, it seems to be surrounded by a cluster of hundreds of objects. We will need to investigate further."
 swp_anomaly.0.a:0 "Send a Science ship."
 swp_Iego_investigation_project:0 "Planet of the Thousand Moons"
 swp_Iego_investigation_project_DESC:0 "Our sensors are detecting a massive debris field between the §Y[Root.GetName]§! and a mysterious planet cloaked in swirling banks of fog. While navigating such a hazard would normally be too risky, spectral analysis of the world's atmosphere suggests that the distant planet is likely to support a thriving tropical ecosystem, and several exotic organic compounds have already been detected. Navigating the debris field could be perilous—some of the asteroids are the size of small moons—but the debris field is so vast that there is no way to avoid plunging through it."
 swp_anomaly.1.name:0 "Planet of the Thousand Moons"
 swp_anomaly.1.desc:0 "Having cleared the debris field with only a few scratches to the §Y[Root.GetName]'s§! paint, our explorers gazed in open wonderment at the tropical planet below them. After cross-referencing the planet's position and description with those found in an ancient starchart, [Root.Leader.GetName] has concluded that the tropical planet must be the fabled world of \"Iego\", and the debris field its fabled \"thousand moons\".\n\nAccording to Outer Rim scholar Professor Rieken Aphra's §GThe Spirits of the Frontier, Volume IX§! Iego and its thousand moons are said to be the home of the legendary §WAngels§!, an immortal species of unmatched beauty. Professor Aphra declines to weigh in on the validity of these mythical beings in his treatment, but he does suggest that the world's mystical legend may be connected to the so-called \"Curse of Drol\", a name first coined in Ganzar Mo'dal'alish's §GPraxeum of the Ash Worlds§!. Though the text remains banned by the Empire due to its \"embrace of pro-Jedi mysticism and fanaticism\", existing references suggest that the Curse describes the tendency of ships transiting this area to go missing. When coupled with the debris field around the planet, [Root.Leader.GetName] has concluded that the Curse is simply a product of the hazards surrounding Iego, and that the Angels were invented to lend an air of mystique and supernaturality to an otherwise unremarkable scientific phenomena. Heartened by this explanation, [Root.Leader.GetName] landed upon the southern tip of the planet's largest continent, where we were surprised to find the small city of Cliffhold perched upon a basalt cliff overlooking the ocean. According to the locals, for nearly two hundred years the city had been a waystation for spice runners transiting Hutt space, who found the thousand moons and debris fields useful to conceal their movements from Republic patrols. Then came Drol.\n\nWhile locals are reluctant to speak of who or what Drol is, roughly two years into the Clone Wars spice runner traffic began to dry up. While skilled smugglers were still able to touch down on Iego for refueling, after leaving the system they were never seen again. Worse still, any attempt to flee the planet, whether by smugglers or civilians, was invariably met with disaster, with ships either foundering on the orbiting debris field, or simply vanishing after slipping the planet's gravity well. It seems that leaving Iego may not be as easy as we had hoped."

Flying by instinct, unassisted by the ship's navigation system, [Root.Leader.GetSheHe] begins to wend through the debris field surrounding Iego and its thousand moons."

 swp_anomaly.3.desc:0 "The §Y[Root.GetName]§! has lost even more paint during the flight from Iego, but with the exception of some frayed nerves, [Root.Leader.GetName] reports that the crew is alive and well. While it will take some additional calculations to optimize the orbital trajectories, we believe that the journey of the §Y[Root.GetName]§ has charted a safe and stable route through the so-called \"Curse of Drol\". Soon our ships will be able to enter and leave Iego at will, and already our engineers are near giddy with excitement at the prospect of recovering propulsion technologies from the countless hulks of ruined starships that populate the debris field."

 swp_anomaly.4.desc:0 "The first few minutes of the §Y[Root.GetName]'s§! flight are uneventful. Under [Root.Leader.GetName]'s careful watch, the ship slips Iego's atmosphere and begins to thread its way through the dense debris field enveloping Iego. It isn't long before \"Drol\" strikes. While maneuvering between a particularly large comet and the scattered carcass of a charred Baleen-class heavy freighter, a brilliant arc of yellow energy lashes out from a nearby asteroid, buckling §Y[Root.GetName]'s§! deflector shields, boiling away hull plating, and cleaving the ship in twain. The spar of pure energy is soon joined by dozens, then hundreds of other beams, which weave together in an intricate net so dense that only the most agile vessels could hope to escape. The sensor signal of the [Root.Leader.GetName] winks out of existence, with all [From.GetSpeciesHandName]s presumed lost."

 swp_anomaly.5.desc:0 "Something is up there. Whether angel or demon, machine or man, something in the debris field enveloping Iego is preventing ships from leaving. We must investigate, the security of the [Root.Owner.GetName] could depend upon it.\n\nGunning the §Y[Root.GetName]'s§! sublight engines, [Root.Leader.GetName] orders the vessel to break atmosphere. It isn't long before \"Drol\" strikes. While maneuvering between a particularly large comet and the scattered carcass of a charred Baleen-class heavy freighter, a brilliant arc of yellow energy lashes out from a nearby asteroid, buckling §Y[Root.GetName]'s§! deflector shields and boiling away hull plating. The spar of pure energy is soon joined by dozens, then hundreds of other beams, which weave together in an intricate net so dense that only the most agile vessels could hope to escape. But as quickly as the net appeared, it is just as quickly gone, with only a few flickering strands remaining.\n\nDrawing close to the source of one of these beams, the §Y[Root.GetName]§! locates a metallic projector embedded in one of the asteroids, and a quick search of other nearby bodies reveals dozens more. Analyzing the spatial orientation of these projectors, [Root.Leader.GetName] concludes that some central source must be beaming them power.\n\nWith the help of [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] trusty R2 unit, [Root.Leader.GetName] deduces the power source's location, a facility embedded in the surface of a small moon. A facility bearing the hexagonal spoked seal of the former Confederacy of Independent Systems. Querying the facility with an old CIS identity code, the facility's automated response system returns only a warning not to approach, and its name, the Distributed Reactive Orbital Laser or, more simply, DROL. With this station keeping our crew and the inhabitants of Iego trapped, it is no longer a question of if we will challenge this so-called \"Drol\", only a question of means."

The first trouble was at the airlock. While the CIS codes had been enough to query the station, the clearance level was deemed insufficient by the station's AI for physical access, resulting in the facility sealing its airlocks to outside entry.\n\nAlthough this initial hurdle was overcome through the use of several demolition charges, the incursion seems to have only further roused the station's defenses. Within minutes, a brigade of Clone Wars-era B2 super battle droids manage to force the intruders out of the station and back to the relative safety of the §Y[Root.GetName]§. While [Root.Leader.GetName] managed to get most of [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] team back in one piece, the §Y[Root.GetName]§ took several wrist-rockets from the B2 super battle droids defending the facility, and will require significant repairs before it can be made spaceworthy."

After plying a particularly sour-faced man with more than a few glasses of a choice NN179 Whyren's Reserve Corellian whiskey, we finally manage to find one that is willing to open up. Calling himself Jaybo Hood, the greying human claims that while the debris field around Iego is deadly enough for many pilots, the real danger stems from an advanced LaserWeb Defense Station hidden among the orbiting rocks. This station, which he alleges was constructed by the Confederacy during the waning days of the Clone Wars, is programmed to activate whenever a ship attempts to escape the planet. Unless a vessel is broadcasting the correct IFF signal, the Station then activates a series of multi-directional laser emitters hidden throughout the debris field, making an already hazardous journey all but impossible. While he claims that the Defense Station was deactivated during the Clone Wars by a pair of Jedi-a claim which most of the bar's other patrons believe to be a fabrication, if not heresy against Drol-this solution proved only temporary, and within two standard years the Curse of Drol had again descended over Iego."

According to the report of our field medic, she took a blaster shot directly to her left thigh, right shoulder, and right knee but was found standing tall at the command station of the §YLodestar§! in spite of these injuries. Once the bridge had been secured and the rest of the ship brought under our control, §YCommander D'Tahn§! surrendered control of the vessel to our operatives and reported to the §YLodestar§!'s medbay.\n\nAll defectors have been accounted for with minimal injuries and §YCommander D'Tahn§! has been sent to our foremost doctors for treatment and eventual debriefing.

Within this building, however, is a sight most remarkable. Lavish interiors decorated with only the finest shimmersilk fabrics and dark red greel wood furniture, the opulence further accented by the heady scent of euphoric, smoked things such as macarn herb, rankweed and cigarra of all shapes and sizes. Further inside this den of sublime depravity and debased debauchery resided droids of increasingly... Exotic design. Some evening having supple, humanoid figures that have been covered in synthskin and biofibers to give the vaguest impression of a biological organism. As our garrison made their way to the main hall, they encountered something... Exotic.\n\nFrom their professional analysis, this establishment is designed with the proliferation of biological and synthetic relations in mind. That is to say... It is a brothel staffed by droids with biological customers. At the present time, there is absolutely no law which remotely covers this sort of establishment and it seems that its owners - the Hutt Cartel - are fully aware of this fact and have been using droids in this manner to evade governmental oversight.

Aside from an open gash in its communications tower, the ships appears to be in fine condition. After a quick sensor scan determined that there were no lifeforms aboard, we dispatched a boarding team to investigate the warship, and ascertain how it came to rest there. Upon entering the ship through an open ventral maintenance hatch, the boarding party quickly restored emergency secondary power throughout the warship, and started the process of repressurizing the vessel's compartments. Proceeding to the bridge, the party was unnerved to discover the frozen, depowered remains of thousands of battle droids, and the well-preserved corpses of hundreds of former crewmen--mostly Neimoidians, Gossams, and a handful of Munns--littering the hallways, their faces contorted in grotesque masks of pain, panic, and terror.\nStepping over the bodies, the boarding party repowered the ships mainframe and, after slicing through its antiquated security ciphers, accessed its datafiles. According to its registration data, the unnamed vessel was a warship in the service of the §BCIS§!, and had been dispatched to §Y[pirate_system.GetName]§! as part of its shakedown cruise. Curiously, only one other file remains uncorrupted: a captain's log, originally uploaded years ago during the height of the Clone Wars. It appears to have been set to broadcast repeatedly across a variety of military frequencies most commonly used by the former CIS, though the damage to the cruiser's communications array seems to have prevented the message's transmission.

Every §YInstitution§! has three different abilities which consume £influence£ §BInfluence§! when activated, and which can be reactivated after a £cooldown£ cooldown. Regardless of the empire played, the first §YInstitution§! ability is a self-buff that is applied empire-wide, and lasts for §Hone year§!. The second ability affects a foreign empire, and imposes a variety of maluses (or occasionally bonuses) to them, such as higher market fees, lower stability. This second ability lasts for §Hthree years§! and can be reactivated after the £cooldown£ cooldown expires. The third ability is, in most cases, an additional empire-wide self-buff, though some affect foreign empires, such as those for the §RRebel Alliance§!, §HHutt Cartel§! or a §MCriminal Syndicate§!.\n\nNot all abilities, however, can be used at any time, and many have conditions that must be met before they can be used. If, for instance, you are playing as the §HHutt Cartel§!, your third ability will need a target which has at least one Outpost, while if you are playing as the §RRebel Alliance§! you must be at war with your target. The third ability lasts for §Hfive years§! and can be reactivated after the cooldown expires.\n\nThe £influence£ §BInfluence§! consumed by the activation of §YInstitution§! abilities are produce by special buildings that can be constructed on your planets. There is, however, a limit to the number of §YInstitution§! buildings you can construct, and you can have only §Hone major§! and §Hthree minor§! §YInstitution§! buildings at any given time. Should a player change their §YInstitution§!, any existing buffs granted by the §YInstitution§! will be removed and any §YInstitution§! buildings will automatically change to match the buildings associated with the new §YInstitution§!.\n\nYou can access the §YInstitution§! menu by pressing the §GQ-Button§! on your keyboard, by opening the edicts tab and clicking on the §GView List-Button§!, or by clicking on the new icon in your §GInterface§!.\n\nMinor empires also have access to the §YInstitution§! system, and have the ability to change their §YInstitution§! every 15 years.\n\nGood luck, and may the Force be with you."

We have sent a crew to the new ship and pressed it into service with our fleet."
 anomaly.2560.desc:0 "Active subsurface scans of the gas giant §Y[From.GetName]§! have picked up what appears to be a large ship deep inside the atmosphere. Judging by the nearby debris, there have been several attempts to salvage this derelict in the past, all of which came to nothing in the end. Any ship strong enough to withstand such crushing gravity would be a valuable asset to our forces, and Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has proposed a salvage project of our own."
 anomaly.2560.a:0 "We must secure this vessel for our own purposes. The risk is worth the reward."
 anomaly.2560.b:0 "We must not risk our own officers in the pursuit of this vessel. Leave the ship for lesser fools to find."
 anomaly.2561.desc:0 "In a masterful display of engineering, the team under Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has managed to gently raise the derelict ship on §Y[From.From.GetName]§! to the gas giant's upper atmosphere. Turns out it's a Liberator Class Cruiser and it seems to be in remarkably good condition. We have restored power to its systems. No trace of the original crew remains, but we have brought over our own and commissioned the ship into the fleet."
 anomaly.2562.desc:0 "The misguided attempt by our foolish Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! to salvage the derelict ship from the atmosphere of §Y[From.From.GetName]§! was a failure. Our officers proceeded without properly preparing for the effect of the planet's electromagnetic shifts in the atmosphere on their engines, resulting in a collision which killed many of the crew sent on the mission. The ancient vessel was pushed even deeper into the atmosphere - beyond our reach. §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has been been put on report for this failure."
 anomaly.2570.desc:0 "One of the many moons circling §Y[From.GetName]§! has a terminal orbit. It will soon collide with the gas giant in what is sure to become a massive impact event. This event has been millions of years in the making, and it is a startling coincidence that the impact has been fated to occur just after a visit by one of our ships.\n\nMany of our scientists wish to observe and record the event, but we only have a narrow window before it is too late."
 anomaly.2571.desc:0 "We were successful in our attempt to record the collision between §Y[CollisionLocation.GetName]§! and its moon! The event was captured from several different angles, and transmitted live over the HoloNet.

 anomaly.5000.desc:0 "The §Y[Root.GetName]§! has picked up some curious readings from §Y[From.GetName]§!. There are significant pockets of radiation in the gas giant's atmosphere that appear to be the result of intense orbital bombardment. What someone could hope to gain by bombing a gas giant from orbit remains a mystery however.\n\nAs the §Y[Root.GetName]§! was preparing to break orbit, Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! discovered a weak signal coming from the planet's interior. It may be a transmission of some kind, but the gas giant's background radiation makes it difficult to isolate."
 anomaly.5000.a:0 "We should investigate this signal."
 anomaly.5000.b:0 "A sensor malfunction. Ignore it."
 anomaly.5001.desc:0 "Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has managed to isolate the weak signal that was coming from somewhere deep inside the atmosphere of §Y[From.From.From.GetName]§!. It does indeed appear to be a transmission, and we have filtered it through our protocol droid."

 anomaly.5003.desc:0 "Finally! Well met, spacefarer! We are the Dathnak, and the planet you are orbiting is Tollok Rong - our ancestral home. It is always riveting to meet a solid, even if our last encounter with your kind was somewhat... problematic.\n\nYou have no doubt detected the radiation surges coming from our atmosphere. Tollok Rong is dying, and our species will perish unless we find a new home. We have identified a planet that would suit our physiology, but we have no means to get there. Sadly, our non-corporeal nature means we don't have much in the way of industry or technology. Will you help us?"
 anomaly.5003.a:0 "If you have no technology, how are we speaking?"
 anomaly.5003.a.response:0 "Ah, but you are not the first solid to pay us a visit! Another spacefarer graciously donated a small subspace transceiver and a scanner array to us 2.9 million solar cycles ago. They had been designed to be compatible with our physiology.\n\nOne of the more positive encounters we've had with your kind."
 anomaly.5003.b:0 "What happened to your planet?"
 anomaly.5003.b.response:0 "Well, the last time solids visited us a few thousand cycles ago, things didn't go very well. They wanted us to embrace their religion, we refused and this triggered some kind of genocidal reaction.\n\nCompletely unwarranted! Before we knew what was happening, they maneuvered their fleet into orbit and unleashed a massive bombardment."
 anomaly.5003.c:0 "You want us to transport your entire species to another planet?"
 anomaly.5003.c.response:0 "Yes! And hopefully soon! Don't worry, there aren't too many of us. Most Dathnak died when our planet was bombarded, and those who survived retreated deeper into the atmosphere. Communication with the surface is difficult here, and the radiation is spreading. We don't have much time!"
 anomaly.5003.d:0 "We will help you relocate."
 anomaly.5003.d.response:0 "Excellent! I knew we could count on you. The navigation route to our new home has been forwarded to your computer.\n\nYou must promise not to let your own colonists claim this alluring world before we get there, no matter how strong the temptation!"
 anomaly.5003.e:0 "Sorry. It would be too much of a hassle."
 anomaly.5003.e.response:0 "I knew it! I warned the others that solids are incapable of feeling compassion, but they insisted on making this humiliating plea.\n\nI know you for what you are - a plague on this galaxy! One day it will be inherited by beings such as us, and there shall be a reckoning. Mark my words. The age of solids will be over! The time of the gaseous life form shall come!"
 anomaly.5004.desc:0 "Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! has finished supervising the relocation of the Dathnak to their new home. A convoy of civilian transports equipped with massive pressurized gas tanks ferried the gaseous beings across space and deposited them into the gas giant's atmosphere. Their ancient transmitter and scanner array were also brought along."
 anomaly.5004.a:0 "Hail them."
 anomaly.5005.desc:0 "The conditions on Tollok Rong have deteriorated to the point where the Dathnak can no longer be saved. The radiation has spread across most of the atmosphere, and the Dathnak survivors have retreated even deeper towards the planet's core where communication with the surface is no longer possible. Eventually the radiation will find its way there as well, rendering their species extinct."
 anomaly.5006.desc:0 "We are forever in your debt! This planet has exceeded our expectations. For the first time in generations, our young can frolic in the upper atmosphere without starting to glow.\n\nWe have decided to call our new home Baldarak after your species.

 anomaly.5006.a:0 "Baldarak? We are [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]..."
 anomaly.5006.a.response:0 "Really? I could have sworn... apologies, but it can be difficult to tell you solids apart. I'm afraid it's too late to change the name now. It has a nice ring to it, though, don't you think?"

Many of us were swept up in a festive mood when we made planetfall, and things got a bit frisky to say the least.\n\nAfter the positive experience we had colonizing Baldarak, a few brave pioneers have asked me to petition you for passage to another gas giant. We have already located a promising candidate within your space that would be suitable for colonization. What do you say, friends?"

 anomaly.5008.desc:0 "As before, a convoy of freighters was assembled to safely transport the Dathnak colonists inside pressurized gas tanks. After a brief journey, they successfully made planetfall on the gas giant which they have named 'New Baldarak'. A satellite was left in orbit to allow for long-range communication with Baldarak."

 anomaly.5009.desc:0 "Greetings from New Baldarak! Things are progressing well here at our new colony. However, we have a small request...\n\nChabky Raddh, one of our colonists, misses her family and friends on Baldarak terribly and wants to go home. Her whining is driving us crazy! If it's not too much to ask, do you think you could take her back?"
 anomaly.5009.a:0 "What?! Absolutely not!"
 anomaly.5009.a.response:0 "We had to try... I hope you don't mind. Chabky will just have to settle down and make the best of the situation, like the rest of us! Sorry for wasting your time, [Root.GetSpeciesName] friends."
 anomaly.5009.b:0 "Sigh... very well."
 anomaly.5009.b.response:0 "Excellent. Hopefully this won't put too much of a strain on your resources, since you'll only be transporting a single individual.

 anomaly.5013.a:0 "Tell us what you have planned."
 anomaly.5013.a.response:0 "We want to infiltrate Baldarak with one of our elite commando units. They will then incite a popular uprising against the decadent elite that lords over our people.

Mothers sew uniforms, and spend their free hours loading munitions and digging trenches. But it is on the young sons and daughters of the Galaxy that the true burden of war falls. And they are not found wanting.

 swnd_mando_generic_events.1.desc: "Due to constant attacks by pirates and insurgents, the §YEmpire§! is seeking out an alternative to protecting important shipments and facilites. Several ranking members of the Imperial military have suggested recruiting §YMandalorians§! as mercenaries and bounty hunters to help with this issue. Known for their long history as fierce warriors, §YMandalorians§! would make the perfect body guards.\n\nIn return for their service, we can pay them in the beskar we've smelted from the armor of former Shadow Collective prisoners captured at the end of the Clone Wars."
 swnd_mando_generic_events.1.a: "Bounty hunters? We don't need their scum."
 swnd_mando_generic_events.1.b: "Mercenaries? We could use their skills."

 ### A Risky Alliance ###
 swnd_mandalorian.10.name: "Proposal"
 swnd_mandalorian.10.desc: "The §YEmpire§! is interested in forming a beneficial relationship with §YMandalore§!. The need for more warships and armor brings Imperial officials to the planet, seeking to establish contracts with MandalMotors and begin mining operations.\n\nIn the short term this might be a good deal; however, the §YEmpire§! might want a bit more than what they've asked for. With leftover clone troopers still lingering after the Siege of Mandalore, all they would need to do is give the order to begin an occupation."
 swnd_mandalorian.10.a: "A garrison of leftover troops is already too much. No deal."
 swnd_mandalorian.10.b: "Inquire further. Perhaps a deal is reasonable."
 swnd_mandalorian.11.name: "Assurance"
 swnd_mandalorian.11.desc: "The outright rejection of the deal has angered §HClans Saxon§! and §HWren§!. However, the §YEmpire§! assures us that §YMandalore§! will eventually accept their presence."
 swnd_mandalorian.11.a: "So be it."
 swnd_mandalorian.12.name: "Inquiry"
 swnd_mandalorian.12.desc: "The interest in contracting MandalMotors comes from the §YEmpire§!'s need more shipwrights in their sphere of influence. If we accept, then MandalMotors must consent to having an 'advisor' on board.\n\nThe mining of beskar is a whole different matter all together, with it only present in §BMandalorian space§! and known for its ability to resist some of the most extreme forms of damage - including lightsabers."
 swnd_mandalorian.12.a: "This might be good for us."
 swnd_mandalorian.12.b: "These terms are unacceptable!"
 swnd_mandalorian.13.name: "Benefactors"
 swnd_mandalorian.13.desc: "With a deal reached, the §YEmpire§! assures our officials that this is only temporary and Mandalore can continue to exist autonomously.\n\nWhether or not they intend to keep their word is not certain."
 swnd_mandalorian.13.a: "Very well."
 swnd_mandalorian.14.name: "Refusal"
 swnd_mandalorian.14.desc: "Our officials adamantly refuse the proposition. The thought of the §YEmpire§! literally strip mining our worlds for our iron and refusing our shipwrights to build on their own would be akin to handing over the planet to them.\n\nThis angers not only the Imperials but a few of the sympathizing clans."
 swnd_mandalorian.14.a: "So be it."

 #### Mando Darksaber Chain ###
 swnd_mandalorian.20.name: "Fate of the Darksaber"
 swnd_mandalorian.20.desc: "During the Clone Wars, the Darksaber was won in single combat between §HPre Vizsla§! and the leader of the §YShadow Collective§! - a Zabrak named §HMaul§!. However, §HMaul§! vanished after being captured by the Republic during the Siege of Mandalore and the fate of the Darksaber is unknown.\n\nIn this time of unease and the looming threat of Imperial aggression, its of the utmost importance we locate this sword and return it to §YMandalore§!."
 swnd_mandalorian.20.a: "It will be done."
 swnd_mandalorian.21.name: "A Barren World"
 swnd_mandalorian.21.desc: "To our surprise, the path to the Darksaber points towards §YDathomir§!. This inhospitable world was the birth place of §HMaul§! and is home to clans of witches. Its a place where one should tread carefully."
 swnd_mandalorian.21.a: "Send some teams over to recover the Darksaber."

 #### Mando Protectors Chain ###
 swnd_mandalorian.30.name: "Protectors"
 swnd_mandalorian.30.desc: "The §HMandalorian Protectors§! aren't directly affiliated with the Houses or Clans but are for the protection of the §HMand'alor§! and their people. As the §YEmpire§! continues to grow in power, its recommended that we seek these groups out in case war comes to §YMandalore§!.\n\nOne group is set up on §YConcord Dawn§! and the other is operating from §YMandalore§!. Having support from one or both of these §HProtector§! orders would better prepare us should this galactic war ever reaches our borders."
 swnd_mandalorian.30.a: "Head to §YConcord Dawn§!."
 swnd_mandalorian.30.b: "Explore §YSundari§!."
 swnd_mandalorian.30.c: "But what if we could have both groups.."
 swnd_mandalorian.31.name: "Fangs"
 swnd_mandalorian.31.desc: "Our small team arrives in the §YConcord Dawn§! system and are greeted by a small group of Fang fighters hailing them.\n\nThe team explains they are looking for a group led by a man named §HFenn Rau§! and are met with silence. 'We'll take you to the §HProtector§! base on the third moon if the credits are right.'"
 swnd_mandalorian.31.a: "If that's what it takes.."
 swnd_mandalorian.31.b: "We are here on behalf of the §HMand'alor§!."
 swnd_mandalorian.32.name: "Arrival"
 swnd_mandalorian.32.desc: "The team follows the fighters to §YConcord Dawn§!'s third moon. Upon landing, they pay their guides and wait for §HRau§!'s arrival. As their guides head off into the camp, the emissaries can hear them laughing.\n\nThe meeting with §HFenn Rau§! is brief. His group of §HMandalorian Protectors§! were once royal guards to the §HMand'alor§! but have since pledged their alliegence to the §YEmpire§! and report on rebel activity. Its no surprise that they also show sympathies toward Clan Saxon. The line of questioning turns to their future with the §YEmpire§!."
 swnd_mandalorian.32.a: "And what if the §YEmpire§! gets tired of the §HProtectors§!?"
 swnd_mandalorian.33.name: "Arrival"
 swnd_mandalorian.33.desc: "'Official business then? Very well.' The emissaries are escorted to the third moon and await their meeting with §HRau§!.\n\nThe meeting with §HFenn Rau§! is brief. His group of §HMandalorian Protectors§! were once royal guards to the §HMand'alor§! but have since pledged their alliegence to the §YEmpire§! and report on rebel activity. Its no surprise they also show sympathies toward §HClan Saxon§!. The line of questioning turns to their future with the §YEmpire§!."
 swnd_mandalorian.33.a: "And what if the §YEmpire§! gets tired of the §HProtectors§!?"
 swnd_mandalorian.34.name: "Questions"
 swnd_mandalorian.34.desc: "§HRau§! grimaces and points towards the landed fighters. 'The §HProtectors§! do enough to maintain order without needing the §YEmpire§! to meddle in our affairs. Being close with the §YEmpire§! ensures our own safety as well.'\n\nHe motions towards an Imperial shuttle taking off in the distance. 'One shuttle does not mean an occupation - Now, does that cover everything?'"
 swnd_mandalorian.34.a: "And what if they grow tired with all of §YMandalore§!?"
 swnd_mandalorian.35.name: "Trade"
 swnd_mandalorian.35.desc: "§HRau§! ponders the question. Despite his band of §HProtectors§! being pulled from the best warriors from all the clans, it does not guarantee that they can stave off a growing Imperial presence. If the situation worsens, they'll have to attempt to collaborate with that group of near §YKeldabe§!.\n\n'We'll keep our promise to protect §YMandalore§! if the war comes to our part of the galaxy. If that happens though, we will need to be properly equipped. Credits mean nothing for us right now. If anything, we would like some supplies in exchange for support.'"
 swnd_mandalorian.35.a: "Provide alloys"
 swnd_mandalorian.35.b: "Provide weapons"
 swnd_mandalorian.35.c: "Provide food"
 swnd_mandalorian.36.name: "Arrangement"
 swnd_mandalorian.36.desc: "With an agreement reached, §HFenn Rau§! leads the emissaries to the shuttle. 'If §YMandalore§! ever needs the support of the §HProtectors of Concord Dawn§!, we will be there.' The shuttle takes off and heads back to §YMandalore§!.\n\nThe meeting with §HFenn Rau§! was more successful than imagined. With the support of his protectors, §YMandalore§! has bolstered its defense against the §YEmpire§!."
 swnd_mandalorian.36.a: "Excellent."
 swnd_mandalorian.37.name: "The Streets"
 swnd_mandalorian.37.desc: "Our emissaries walk the streets of §YSundari§!, looking for signs of the secretive group. This group of §HProtectors§! have remained elusive since before the Siege of Mandalore due to their troubled past supporting the Separatists.\n\nOne of the emissaries' bodyguards notice someone following them, staying a few meters a way at all times."
 swnd_mandalorian.37.a: "Call out to them."
 swnd_mandalorian.37.b: "Keep moving"
 swnd_mandalorian.38.name: "Assailants"
 swnd_mandalorian.38.desc: "The stranger quickly draws their blaster and aims it at the one of the emissaries. Before they could fire, another blaster rings out and the assailant drops dead. 'That's another one, damned Imperials.' A figure in beskar armor jumps from the roof top and lands in front of the emissaries.\n\n'If you're looking for §HFenn Shysa§!, he's not around here. He's stationed out in §YOlankur§! with the rest of us. I'm only here to keep an eye on Imperials in the new capital.' The armored figure holsters their blaster. 'I'll let him know some emissaries from the Mand'alor are on their way.' With a nod, the supercommando takes off."
 swnd_mandalorian.38.a: "Onwards to §YOlankur§!."
 swnd_mandalorian.39.name: "Assailants"
 swnd_mandalorian.39.desc: "The emissaries and their escorts continue on when two other strangers come out of the alleyways. Sensing their intent, the emissaries and bodyguards draw their blasters, leading to a stand off between them and the assailants.\n\nBefore any of them could fire, a faint whistling is heard and all three assasins collapse dead with small explosions. 'Damned Imperials. I can see you're emissaries for the §HMand'alor§!. If you're looking for §HFenn Shysa§!, he's out in §YOlankur§! with the rest of us. I'll inform him that you're on your way. Stay safe.' With a nod, the supercommando takes off."
 swnd_mandalorian.39.a: "Onwards to §YOlankur§!."
 swnd_mandalorian.40.name: "Beyond Keldabe"
 swnd_mandalorian.40.desc: "The emissaries and their retinue arrive in §YOlankur§!, far from the old capital of §YKeldabe§!. They are escorted to a hidden camp in some old Republic wreckage. A man walks up to the emissaries and extends his hand. 'Suppose yer lookin' for §HShysa§!? Name's §HTobbi Dala§!. Served with him and our founder §HSpar§! during the Clone Wars.' After a brief exchange, §HShysa§! himself appears out of his shelter. §HDala§! nods at him as he walks up.\n\nThe emissaries explain that it won't be long before the war with the rebellion reaches §BMandalorian space§!. Before they continue, §HShysa§! interrupts. 'If you want us to fight against the Empire, say no more. We've been fightin' them since the war ended.'"
 swnd_mandalorian.40.a: "Excellent news!"
 swnd_mandalorian.41.name: "Meeting Shysa"
 swnd_mandalorian.41.desc: "§HShysa§! explains that his group of §HProtectors§! have been striking Imperial installations on and off since the Republic transformed. With §HSpar§! severely traumatized by their last mission together in the war and subsequent disappearance, leadership of the §HMandalorian Protectors§! has fallen upon him.\n\nWhen asked about §HFenn Rau's Protectors on Concord Dawn§!, he starts to laugh. 'Traitors through and through. Being their informants is no better than an Imperial themselves.' As their meeting ends, §HShysa§! reassures his support against the §YEmpire§! however; he requests some additional supplies to carry out his raids."
 swnd_mandalorian.41.a: "Provide essential goods."
 swnd_mandalorian.41.b: "Provide weapons."
 swnd_mandalorian.41.c: "Provide comms."
 swnd_mandalorian.42.name: "Deal"
 swnd_mandalorian.42.desc: "With a shipment of supplies ready to be delivered to §HFenn Shysa§!'s forces, the §HMandalorian Protectors§! have reaffirmed their support for the §HMand'alor§!. If trouble should arise with the §YEmpire§!, they will be ready.\n\nBefore departing back to §YSundari§!, §HShysa§! informs them that if they need to bolster their forces when war arises, he will personally see to it that some Protectors are available."
 swnd_mandalorian.42.a: "§HShysa's Protectors§! will be an important asset of ours."
 swnd_mandalorian.43.name: "Two Missions"
 swnd_mandalorian.43.desc: "Both §HProtector§! groups fought on two different sides of the Clone Wars and those wounds have yet to fully heal. With the growing might of the §YEmpire§!, having the §HMandalorian Protectors§! divided will no doubt weaken §YMandalore§! from within.\n\nReaching out to both groups of §HProtectors§! will be no easy feat. Emissaries will need to be sent to §YConcord Dawn§! to meet with §HFenn Rau§! while another group is sent out to find §YFenn Shysa§! on Mandalore. Afterwards, they will be brought here. Setting up a meeting between leadership of both might lead to furious blows but once the dust settles, maybe an arrangement can be made."
 swnd_mandalorian.43.a: "Nothing wrong with a little pre-talk brawl."
 #swnd_mandalorian.44.name: "Separate Meetings"
 #swnd_mandalorian.44.desc: "The meeting at Concord Dawn starts off with no problems, beyond Fenn Rau's stubborness regarding the Empire. When told that some other representatives are meeting with Fenn Shysa's Protectors, he grows irritated. He mentions that Shysa's lot worked for the Confederacy while his Protectors acted as guards for the late Dutchess and teachers for clones.\n\nMeanwhile out in the Olankur, Shysa's group seems willing to help against the Empire, with him commenting on their raids on installations tracking down Imperial agents. When asked about the possibility of working with Rau's Protectors, he shakes his head and firmly states he will not work with traitors."
 #swnd_mandalorian.44.a: "We need to reach a resolution!"
 swnd_mandalorian.44.name: "Two Protectors"
 swnd_mandalorian.44.desc: "Arranging the meeting with both leaders proves to be very difficult. Both agree to meet at §YSundari§! with a small cadre. They arrive at the capital, §HRau§! with his trusted guards and §HShysa§! with his and his second-in-command §HTobbi Dala§!.\n\nThe meeting goes smoothly at first. The two leaders are both interested in the safety and protection of §YMandalore§! and its people. But both §HProtectors§! are completely opposed to working with each other. §HRau§! and his men once served as teachers for clone troopers and the late §HDutchess§! while §HShysa§! and his men once served as agents of the §YConfederacy§!.\n\nWith tensions rising and the word 'traitor' being thrown around, it won't be long before blasters are drawn."
 swnd_mandalorian.44.a: "This is madness!"
 swnd_mandalorian.45.name: "Understanding"
 swnd_mandalorian.45.desc: "When told of the growing relationship between §HClan Saxon§! and the §YEmpire§!, both sides start to come to the realization that despite their past, the protection of §BMandalorian space§! is more important. A divided Mandalore is easier to conquer than a unified one. The Protectors will have to cooperate to ensure that the Empire's ambitions for Mandalore never come to fruition."
 swnd_mandalorian.45.a: "Finally, a resolution!"
 swnd_mandalorian.46.name: "Realization"
 swnd_mandalorian.46.desc: "The representatives grow impatient and remind both sides that a divided Mandalore is easier to conquer than a united one. They mention that even though the §HProtectors§! have their own stakes, its the clans that are most at risk. While some clans oppose the Imperials, others are openly collaborating with them.\n\nWhen told of the growing relationship between §HClan Saxon§! and the §YEmpire§!, both sides start to come to the realization that despite their past, the protection of §BMandalorian space§! is more important. The §HProtectors§! will have to cooperate to ensure that the §YEmpire§!'s ambitions for §YMandalore§! never come to fruition."
 swnd_mandalorian.46.a: "Finally, a resolution!"
 swnd_mandalorian.47.name: "A Vow to Protect"
 swnd_mandalorian.47.desc: "With both parties finally realizing what as truly at stake, they vow to aid in the fight against the §YEmpire§! when trouble arises. Both §HFenn Rau§! and §HFenn Shysa§! pledge their support and offer up some of their Supercommandos to supplement our forces.\n\nAs all parties part ways, there is the reassurance that Mandalore will be ready to withstand the §YEmpire§! when the war finally enters §BMandalorian Space§!."
 swnd_mandalorian.47.a: "Vode an!"
 swnd_mandalorian.48.name: "Unforunate Circumstances"
 swnd_mandalorian.48.desc: "Despite our best efforts, neither §HRau§! nor §HShysa's Protectors§! would agree to work with each other and the §HMand'alor§!. The inability to find common ground might hinder our efforts to preserve §YMandalore§! in the long run. However, as long as one group is willing to honor their role as §HProtectors§! of §YMandalore§!, then we can survive."
 swnd_mandalorian.48.a: "So be it."

 #swnd_mandalorian.30.name: "Two Houses"
 #swnd_mandalorian.30.desc: "Ever since the death of Mandalore the Ultimate, our people have lived on the fringes of galactic affairs. Divided, exiled, and slaughtered. Amidst all the strife, different clans and factions have tried to seize power but we have yet to be fully united under a single Mand'alor.\n\nTwo houses lie at the center of this issue. House Kryze, led by Lady Regent Bo-Katan Kryze of Clan Kryze and House Viszla, made up of three competing clans - Clan Wren, Clan Vizsla, and Clan Saxon."
 #swnd_mandalorian.30.a: "Support House Kryze."
 #swnd_mandalorian.30.b: "Support House Vizsla"
 #swnd_mandalorian.18.name: "Clan Kryze"
 #swnd_mandalorian.18.desc: "Clan Kryze holds a special place in the recent history of Mandalore. It was under Satine Kryze that an attempt was made to reform Mandalorian society but the Clone Wars brought a new wave of problems in the form of Death Watch and the Shadow Collective.\n\nUnder Bo-Katan, the members of House Kryze will try and rally support and unify a fractured Mandalore."

 #swnd_mandalorian.19.name: "Three Clans"
 #swnd_mandalorian.19.desc: "The internal politics of House Vizsla boils down to actions of Clan Wren, Saxon, and Vizsla themselves.

 #swnd_mandalorian.20.desc: "The support for Clan Vizsla is met with cautious optimism. Pre Vizsla's death was at the hands of an outsider and with the threat of the Empire growing, its likely that history will repeat itself with a new Mand'alor from this clan. "
