 d_communal_hives: "Communal Hives"
 d_communal_hives_desc: "Complex hive networks that were used for the raising of Neimoidian grubs. The reality of these hives was brutal and harsh, as a grub would spend the first seven years of its life within the communal hives, being fed only small amounts of food. This would encourage hoarding and stealing from weaker Neimoidians. The end product was a generation of Neimoidians who had been ingrained with the values of greed and fear of death. It was believed this would make them all the more prepared for the world of commerce."
 d_fungus_farms: "Fungus Farms"
 d_fungus_farms_desc: "Whilst most Neimoidians would have left their home planet, the weakest in society were left to manage the agricultural needs of their worlds, focused on insect hives, fungus farms and beetle hatcheries.

 d_jixuan_desert_desc: "A vast body of sand on the southern hemisphere of Ryloth, Jixuan Desert is a barren, scorching hot mix of plains and sand dunes that few would be foolish enough to travel unprepared. Settlements are far between, with the Twi'lek preference to live underground not easily compatible with the shifting sands of the desert. Those that do live here endure difficult conditions. The Jixuan Desert is best known as the site of a decisive battle for the southern hemisphere during the Clone Wars, a battle won by Master Kenobi."
 d_tulara_ravine: "Tulara Ravine"
 d_tulara_ravine_desc: "The Tulara Ravine was rather a sequence of naturally formed trenches, a vast network that stretches across the entire region. Starships would struggle to navigate comfortably within the confined spaces of the Tulara Ravine. Locals attribute this geographical wonder to having a disorienting maze-like quality, and claim many have failed to return. Any traveler that does not get lost in the maze itself, should be aware that the wildlife that reside there have a reputation for hostility."
 d_tann_province: "Tann Province"
 d_tann_province_desc: "Occupied by the CIS and liberated by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars, Tann Province is no stranger to foreign occupation.

 d_mon_cala_city: "Mon Cala City"
 d_mon_cala_city_desc: "Unlike other cities on the planet, Mon Cala City was entirely submerged under the ocean. Built directly on top of a coral reef on the sea floor, it is the traditional seat of the Monarchy, though currently King Lee Char has chosen to establish his court on Dac City. Approaching by submersible, visitors would be met by an underwater skyline of towering structures, inspired almost entirely by the design of the Mon Calamari MC80 Star Cruiser. Anyone arriving would be forgiven for assuming the Mon Calamari had parked their fleet underwater. The city was the unfortunate host of one of the biggest underwater battles of the Clone Wars."
 d_great_ungeness_trench: "Great Ungeness Trench"
 d_great_ungeness_trench_desc: "The Great Ungeness Trench is a vast cavern on the ocean floor, close to Dac City. Its depth means that sunlight never reaches its waters, and as such it is shrouded in constant darkness. Few have descended to such depths, even among the Mon Calamari. Tales of a squid like creature of enormous scale have often been whispered among locals, but no evidence has ever been presented to suggest that these are anything more than ancient mythology."
 d_caverns_hidden_one: "Caverns of the Hidden One"
 d_caverns_hidden_one_desc: "Natural caverns found deep below the surface of Dorin. In secret they were further excavated under the instructions of Baran Do Master Tokra Hazz, who in the aftermath of the Clone Wars was concerned for the survival of the Order with the rise of the Galactic Empire. The original caverns were dramatically expanded and equipped to ensure the future of the Order. It was the responsibility of a new sect, known as the Hidden Ones, to safeguard these caverns and when the time was right, to reform the Baran Do Order."
 d_sinkhole_cities: "Sinkhole Cities"
 d_sinkhole_cities_desc: "The force of the winds on Utapau have made it impossible for settlements to be sustainable on the planet's surface. Over time, hyperwind storms have only added to the challenge. This has left the Pau'an and Utai to adapt the natural sinkholes for their purposes. Layered cities were built within the sinkholes themselves, still utilizing the wind on the surface by harnessing wind turbine generators. Whilst Utapau has enjoyed a peaceful history, Pau City, the planet's capital, was one of the great battlefields of the Clone Wars."
 d_temple_illumination: "Temple of Illumination"
 d_temple_illumination_desc: "Headquarters of the Chalactan Adepts, a mystical and philosophical order. The Temple of Illumination provided space for those seeking Chalactan Enlightenment.

 d_crystal_caves_ilum: "Crystal Caves"
 d_crystal_caves_ilum_desc: "Within the ruins of the ancient Jedi Temple are the Crystal Caves. Jedi younglings who were identified with potential were sent into these caves in order to find kyber crystals for their first lightsaber, in a ritual that was known as The Gathering. The Crystal Caves have a sacred and important history within the Jedi Order. It was the wealth of crystals in this cave that led to the establishment of the Temple upon its entrance. There are few more sacred sites for the Jedi."
 d_cross_shelf_corridor: "Cross-Shelf Corridor"
 d_cross_shelf_corridor_desc: "This corridor allowed safe transit between the Western Ice Shelf and the Jedi ruins on the Eastern Ice Shelf. Without this corridor it would be virtually impossible to make the journey between the two. The corridor has been of interest to off-world mining corporations in the past. The Minos-Mestra Corporation had attempted to establish mining operations here during the Old Republic, only for their miners to unintentionally disturb the graves of Sith Lord Xalek's ancestors. Enraged, the Sith Lord would slaughter the miners."
 d_western_ice_shelf: "Western Ice Shelf"
 d_western_ice_shelf_desc: "The Western Ice Shelf has changed little since the days of the Old Republic. The site of heavy fighting between the Old Republic and the Sith Empire, thousands of winters have hidden any signs of the bloody history of this region. Forgotten military bases, and battlements have been lost to the unrelenting snowfall. It is believed this region has thousands of unmarked graves that have been lost for generations."
 d_massassi_ruins: "Massassi Ruins"
 d_massassi_ruins_desc: "Constructed under the orders of Sith Lord Naga Sadow, the Massassi Ruins are a collection of stone temples, mostly situated together, though some were scattered across the jungle moon. Amongst the ruins were some of the most important sites on Yavin 4. These sites include the Great Temple, The Palace of the Woolamander, and The Temple of the Blueleaf Cluster. Whilst named after the Massassi warriors who once inhabited these lands, the vast complex has been abandoned for several millennia."
 d_local_industry: "Local Industry"
 d_local_industry_desc: "Individual villages have started to establish their own factories producing clothing, medpacs, small arms, luxury goods... The list is extensive. Their industrialization is meager in comparison to the vast industrial powerhouses that feed galactic demand, but there's no doubt that local industry has boosted the planetary economy."
 d_regional_industry: "Regional Industry"
 d_regional_industry_desc: "The planetary government has identified the growing industrialization of a region and has authorized laws that reduce red tape, remove environmental restrictions, and encourage further expansion. Almost overnight factories and refineries have been constructed, producing significant quantities of medpacs, clothing, luxury goods, droids, small arms... The list is vast. Whilst it will not compete with some worlds, what is clear is that this planet is reaping the rewards of a developed and capable industrial base."
 d_local_enterprise: "Local Enterprise"
 d_local_enterprise_desc: "Local business leaders have banded together in an effort to compete with off-world interest groups trying to under cut the local economy. To this end they have formed a corporation on the planet to make the most of local enterprise. The decision to join efforts seems to have been a good one. The corporation continues to turn a profit and boost local economies."
 d_regional_enterprise: "Regional Enterprise"
 d_regional_enterprise_desc: "A moderately sized corporation has taken an interest in this planet. Whilst not a major galactic corporation, the scale of their operation cannot be underestimated. Establishing their main headquarters here has had a dramatic effect on the local economy. Some are concerned this is the beginning of yet another world dominated by a ruthless corporation, and as the corporation grows that may be a possibility. For now though, the benefits seem too good to turn down."
 d_rich_culture: "Rich Culture"
 d_rich_culture_desc: "This planet is a cultural oasis, and those that reside here enjoy being steeped in a heritage and history richer than most worlds. Peace and prosperity have allowed the cultivation of art, music, food and entertainment in a way that other worlds can only dream of. Culture of such value surely binds the planetary community together deeply."
 d_local_exchange: "Local Exchange"
 d_local_exchange_desc: "Local villages have a long history of commerce and trade between themselves, and those foundations have encouraged masterful skill surrounding the bureaucracy and common currency across this world. Every village contains a flea market or bazaar offering access to a variety of common goods for purchase. Despite regulations, the trading practices in these markets can often be suspect at best, and illegal at worst. The localized nature of these markets makes it difficult for the planetary government to enforce high standards."
 d_regional_exchange: "Regional Exchange"
 d_regional_exchange_desc: "Commerce has expanded rapidly across this world, and the local economy is booming. The planetary government's response was to establish Regional Exchanges for each of the planet's districts. Hubs for trade and commerce with the infrastructure to support the storage and transport of goods. It has become common practice for villages to send dignitaries to sell and buy goods at these regional hubs, and for local entrepreneurs to establish permanent shops there, all encouraging further prosperity."
 d_traffic_hub: "Intergalactic Traffic Hub"
 d_traffic_hub_desc: "A vast complex of warehouses, custom buildings, starship berths and passenger departure lounges, the Intergalactic Traffic Hub is the end result of a long history of trial and error to expand commerce across the planet. What started as village trade has now expanded on a vast scale to include imports and exports off-world. Never one to miss an opportunity, the planetary government has encouraged the use of the Hub as a means of imposing tariffs on goods coming through. Trade has never been so prosperous for this world."
 d_innovative_architecture: "Innovative Architecture"
 d_innovative_architecture_desc: "Across the galaxy are a wealth of innovations to bring about destruction and death, but here stands a people who are not innovators of how to tear something down, but rather raise something up.

Historians believe this to be due to the fact that many Zeffo could wield The Force, which they referred to as the 'Life Wind' and those who did often became sages, guiding their people. Unfortunately, as the years went by, the Zeffo culture became corrupted. This lead their civilization to the point of extinction, causing the few remaining Zeffo to flee into the unknown regions in hopes of finally finding peace."

By the outbreak of the Separatist Crisis and the Clone Wars, the sector was safeguarded by a self-imposed isolation.

Usually this happens during a supernova explosion. When the star ends its evolution in a catastrophic explosive process, it flares up, releasing a huge amount of energy and leaving a nebula behind. Later the remains can become condensed and turn into a neutron star or a black hole. Gravitational and electromagnetic waves emitted by a dying star interfere with the operation of engines and make it difficult for ships to disengage from battle."

Magnetars are capable of emitting such strong flashes of gamma and X-ray radiation, that they can damage electronic equipment located billions of kilometers from the star. The average life span of a magnetar is about 1 million years. Because of the strong magnetic field, movement around the magnetar is difficult, and the radiation emitted, disrupts the operation of reflectors, rendering the shields of ships and stations useless."
