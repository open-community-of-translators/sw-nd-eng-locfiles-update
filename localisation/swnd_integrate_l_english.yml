The fate of the §Yglitterstim§! £sr_sw_spice£ §Yspice§!, however, remains an open question.\n\nOur accountants estimate that the cargo could fetch several million £energy£ §Ycredits§! if confiscated and sold into the underground economy, though some of [Root.Owner.GetRulerTitle] [Root.Owner.GetRulerName]'s senior advisors have urged us to destroy the £sr_sw_spice£ §Yspice§! to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands."

Upon arriving, they are instructed to retrieve one, and only one, of the thousands of identical camtonos lining the chamber's walls and hallways. And one by one, they fail, having selected camtonos containing only trivial curios or useless flimsiplast copies of government records. We were about to end the ritual when, finally, one of the aspirants succeeded.\n\nWithout waiting to receive instructions like the others, §Y[general.GetName]§! stepped into the labyrinthine and made his way straight to the camtono concealing the §RMortis Dagger§!. Without hesitation, [general.GetSheHe] withdrew the container from its resting place on a lower shelf and, after entering a nine-digit code which [general.GetSheHe] could not have possibly known into its Magna-lock, retrieved the dagger from within.\n\nSince the ritual's completion, the §RMortis Dagger§! has been [general.GetSheHe]'s constant companion, either hung around [general.GetHerHis] neck from a leatheris cord, or clutched tightly in [general.GetHerHis] right hand. Already a talented commander, §Y[general.GetName]§! has developed into an almost peerless warrior, one whose savagery in combat is matched only by the tactical brilliance of [general.GetHerHis] leadership.\n\nSome of §Y[general.GetName]§!'s subordinates have, however, reported that their superior has become increasingly erratic since taking up the §RMortis Dagger§!, talking to [general.GetHerHim]self in the middle of briefings, failing to recognize old friends, and perhaps most concerning of all, intentionally scarring the inside of [general.GetHerHis] hand with the §RDagger's§! tip."
