The vessel has been impounded, and the smugglers are currently being escorted to [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] to await trial. The fate of the §Yglitterstim§! £sr_sw_spice£ §Yspice§!, however, remains an open question. Our accountants estimate that the cargo could fetch several million £energy£ §Ycredits§! if confiscated and sold into the underground economy, though some of [Root.Owner.GetRulerTitle] [Root.Owner.GetRulerName]'s senior advisors have urged us to destroy the £sr_sw_spice£ §Yspice§! to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands."

We were about to end the ritual when, finally, one of the aspirants succeeded.\n\nWithout waiting to receive instructions like the others, §Y[general.GetName]§! stepped into the labyrinthine and made his way straight to the camtono concealing the §RMortis Dagger§!. Without hesitation, [general.GetSheHe] withdrew the container from its resting place on a lower shelf and, after entering a nine-digit code which [general.GetSheHe] could not have possibly known into its Magna-lock, retrieved the dagger from within.\n\nSince the ritual's completion, the §RMortis Dagger§! has been [general.GetSheHe]'s constant companion, either hung around [general.GetHerHis] neck from a leatheris cord, or clutched tightly in [general.GetHerHis] right hand. Already a talented commander, §Y[general.GetName]§! has developed into an almost peerless warrior, one whose savagery in combat is matched only by the tactical brilliance of [general.GetHerHis] leadership.\n\nSome of §Y[general.GetName]§!'s subordinates have, however, reported that their superior has become increasingly erratic since taking up the §RMortis Dagger§!, talking to [general.GetHerHim]self in the middle of briefings, failing to recognize old friends, and perhaps most concerning of all, intentionally scarring the inside of [general.GetHerHis] hand with the §RDagger's§! tip."
